# My API

This is a personal project for my own growth and exploration of crypto.com V2 API for spot trades.

I decided to make a repo in case I make anything worthwhile or an actual app here.

## [API Doc](api-doc.md)

This is a personal document made from crypto.com exchange's [official documentation](https://exchange-docs.crypto.com/spot/index.html). I made it more applicable for me and my learning with not much changes, honestly.

### Disclaimer

I am don't claim to own the API and the api DOC is made by crypto.com exchange itself I just made some minor changes for my own learning
This is my first disclaimer/legal doc, did I do it rightðŸ¥º
